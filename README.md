## here is some stuff

So this is where we will put our code.

## Including Code

An importnat part of a markdown is that it inclues all your jazz.

`{r cars} summary(cars)`

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

`{r pressure, echo=FALSE} head(pressy)`

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
